Password Generator using Python
The best way to learn a programming language is to practically use it. In this project, we will create a Password Generator using Python. This Password Generator will help you create strong and secure passwords to enhance the security of your system.

About Password Generator
In today's world, security is of paramount importance when working on a computer system. To ensure the security of your system at the user level, it is crucial to use strong and protective passwords. Protective passwords should not include easily guessable elements such as your date of birth, name, surname, etc.

So, what should you use? You should use a random password generating application that can create passwords that are difficult for others to guess and misuse. In this project, we will create a password generating application using Python.

Python Password Generator Project Details
For creating the Password Generator, we will be using the Tkinter module to create a user-friendly GUI window and adding necessary fields to it. To generate the password, we will utilize the random module to ensure that a random and secure password is generated.

Prerequisites for Password Generator using Python
Before proceeding with the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Understanding of the basic concepts of Python.
Install the Tkinter module for creating the GUI in Python:
Copy code
pip install tk
Install the Random module for generating random numbers:
arduino
Copy code
pip install random
Steps to Create a Password Generator using Python
Importing Required Libraries:

python
Copy code
# Importing required libraries for TechVidvan Password Generator project using Python
from msilib.schema import CheckBox
import random
from tkinter import *
import string
import tkinter
Here, we import the necessary libraries, including Tkinter for creating the GUI, random for generating random values, and string for working with string literals.

Creating GUI Window:

python
Copy code
# Creating a window
window = Tk()
window.title('TechVidvan')  # Window title
window.geometry('500x500')  # Window geometry

Label(window, font=('bold', 10), text='PASSWORD GENERATOR').pack()  # Adding label to the window
We create a GUI window using Tk() and set its title and geometry. We also add a label to the window with specified font and text.

Creating password_generate() Function:

python
Copy code
# Function to generate password
def password_generate(length):
    valid_chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789@_'
    password = ''.join(random.sample(valid_chars, length))
    l = Label(window, text=password, font=('bold', 20))  # Displaying the generated password
    l.place(x=190, y=50)
This function generates a random password of a specified length. It uses a set of valid characters and the random.sample() method to create the password, which is then displayed on the window.

Creating Checkboxes:

python
Copy code
Checkbutton(text='4 characters', onvalue=4, offvalue=0, variable=len1).place(x=200, y=150)
Checkbutton(text='6 characters', onvalue=6, offvalue=0, variable=len2).place(x=200, y=170)
Checkbutton(text='8 characters', onvalue=8, offvalue=0, variable=len3).place(x=200, y=190)
We create three checkboxes for choosing the password length (4 characters, 6 characters, or 8 characters). Each checkbox is associated with a variable (len1, len2, len3) to store the chosen length.

python
Copy code
# Converting string input to integer
len1 = tkinter.IntVar()
len2 = tkinter.IntVar()
len3 = tkinter.IntVar()
We convert the values of these checkboxes to integers using IntVar().

Function to Get the Length of Password:

python
Copy code
# Function to check the checkbox
def get_len():
    if len1.get() == 4:
        password_generate(4)
    elif len2.get() == 6:
        password_generate(6)
    elif len3.get() == 8:
        password_generate(8)
    else:
        password_generate(6)
This function checks which checkbox is selected and calls password_generate() with the corresponding password length. If no checkbox is selected, it generates a default 6-character password.

Creating Button and Main Command to Run:

python
Copy code
Button(window, text='Generate', font=('normal', 10), bg='yellow', command=get_len).place(x=200, y=100)
We create a button labeled 'Generate' that, when clicked, triggers the get_len() function. The button has a yellow background color and is placed at specific coordinates on the window.

Running the Window:

python
Copy code
window.mainloop()  # Run the window
Finally, we execute the mainloop() method to run the window and display the GUI.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Password Generator using Python with a user-friendly GUI. Now, let's take a look at how our GUI window looks.
